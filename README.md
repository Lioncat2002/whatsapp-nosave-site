# whatsapp-nosave-site
Just input a person's phone number to chat with them without saving their contact
A website I made based on a whatapp api I found
Link to website: https://whatsappnosave.netlify.app/

## Note
The website shown in the repository is a minimum viable product(mvp).</br>


## How did I get this idea?
Well a few days ago I had been reading up news and I noticed this [article](https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/whatsapp-trick-how-to-send-message-to-an-unsaved-number-11587312477237.html) </br>
This gave me the idea</br>
As the articles says, it's a very simple api which just redirects you to the chat connected to that phone number</br>

## Future work on this?
Nah this is just a small project I thought about implementing after aeeing that article
